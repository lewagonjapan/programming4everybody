## Welcome to Programming for Everybody - Season 16!

Over the past 4 years, we've welcomed **more than 1,000 participants** for this free Programming for Everybody webinar series. Now, it's your turn üòé

This repository contains all the files you'll see during the webinars of the course Programming for Everybody hosted by [Le Wagon Tokyo](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo). Welcome aboard! üéâ

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

Any tool you see a teacher using during a live session is **free to use** and **optional** to this course. The applications we'll present are used by thousands of successful tech companies around the world (including us!), and we'll utilise them to show you how to work in a real development environment.

If you don‚Äôt have any prior experience, please just follow the session, ask your eventual questions at the end of it, write and share your experience with your classmates on [the Slack workspace](https://le-wagon-tokyo.slack.com), and **don‚Äôt do anything else described here**. As explained during the program presentation, this course is just an extension of the [Codecademy Ruby track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby), and you are not required to do anything more than following the meetings.

## Usage

Please star the repository, or just bookmark the page in your favourite browser.

Each Ruby file you see in this repository will be filled by a teacher during the corresponding session. In the [`slides`](https://github.com/lewagonjapan/programming4everybody/tree/jan-2024/slides) folder you can see and download the slides we share during our lessons.

## Setup

**N.B:** This is a free online learning series, and our teachers **won't** be able to help you with your computer configuration. If you are just moving your first steps (you don't know Git, Ruby, what a terminal is, or any of the tools we are using), please just watch the videos and, if you feel confident enough, use a REPL as described below. Want to learn to configure your computer like a pro? **[Do it with us!](#going-further)**

### REPL

You can use a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) to see and interact with the code we share every session.

First, [create an account on Repl.it](https://repl.it/signup).

You can use the Ruby console on the right to run quick tests, or create more complex files and execute them from the integrated shell.
If the shell window is not displaying automatically, open it manually or with the ‚åò‚áßS shortcut (see the first picture below), and run your test files from there with `ruby test/name_of_the_file.rb`.
