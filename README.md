## Welcome to Programming for Everybody
This repository contains all the files you'll see during the webinars of the course Programming for Everybody hosted by [Le Wagon Tokyo](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo). Welcome aboard! üéâ

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

Any tool you see a teacher using during a live session is **free to use** and **optional** to this course. The applications we'll present are used by thousands of successful tech companies around the world (including us!), and we'll utilise them to show you how to work in a real development environment.

If you don‚Äôt have any prior experience, please just follow the session, ask your eventual questions at the end of it, write and share your experience with your classmates on [the Slack workspace](https://le-wagon-tokyo.slack.com), and **don‚Äôt do anything else described here**. As explained during the program presentation, this course is just an extension of the [Codecademy Ruby track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby), and you are not required to do anything more than following the meetings.

## Usage

Please star the repository, or just bookmark the page in your favourite browser.

Each Ruby file you see in this repository will be filled by a teacher during the corresponding session. In the slides folder, you can see and download the slides we share during our lessons.

## Setup

**N.B:** This is a free online learning series, and our teachers **won't** be able to help you with your computer configuration. If you are just moving your first steps (you don't know Git, Ruby, what a terminal is, or any of the tools we are using), please just watch the videos and, if you feel confident enough, use a REPL as described below. Want to learn to configure your computer like a pro? **[Do it with us!](#going-further)**

### REPL

You can use a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) to see and interact with the code we share every session.

First, [create an account on Repl.it](https://repl.it/signup).

You can use the Ruby console on the right to run quick tests, or create more complex files and execute them from the integrated shell.
If the shell window is not displaying automatically, open it manually or with the ‚åò‚áßS shortcut (see the first picture below), and run your test files from there with `ruby test/name_of_the_file.rb`.

## General overview

Our program has 6 lessons and we follow [Codecademy‚Äôs free Ruby track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby).
Schedule for each module is shown belowüëá Make sure you complete the respective modules **before** each session:

1. Introduction to Ruby
2. Control flow in Ruby & Looping with Ruby
3. Arrays and Hashes & Blocks and Sorting
4. Hashes and Symbols
5. Object-Oriented Programming, Part 1 & Part 2

## Typical session

- _7:00-8:00pm JST_ **Live session** on Zoom with Le Wagon's teachers showing lots of live-demos to help you understand the concepts using practical examples
- _8:00-8:15pm JST_ **Q&A session** where you'll be able to ask the teachers any question you might have for a live help
- _8:15pm-?_ **Keep coding!** Use [the Slack workspace](https://le-wagon-tokyo.slack.com) to find a buddy and work with him, interact with other classmates, or just send a funny gif üôà

Some sessions might last longer than 1h15 depending on the Q&A part.
For each session, a private Zoom link will be shared on the course Slack channel. The Zoom meetings and Slack workspace are **private**, and only authorised participants can access them üîí

## Asking Questions

The most successful students during our previous sessions asked a lot of questions! For that purpose, we set up a #codecademy-questions channel on Slack - Don't hesitate to use it üòâ

## Certificate

We will be distributing a certificate of completion to those who:

- Attend ALL six live sessions from start to finish
- Complete 100% of the Codecademy track

After the last lecture on Thursday, February 11th, we will ask you to submit your Codecademy username to confirm completion of the Ruby track.
